//Let's pseudocode what we want to do first

//STEP ONE:  Let's link to the GIPHY API using our API Key

//STEP TWO: Let's console log it to ensure everything is linked properly

//STEP THREE: Let's make an array of strings for our topic (reactions)
  //Save it to a variable call topics

//STEP FOUR: Let's get functionality for when our buttons are pressed to display images
  //Use a loop that appends a button for each string in the array

//STEP FIVE: Let's make an AJAX call using jQuery to grab 10 static images for each button

//STEP SIX: Let's add functionality to pause/play our gifs when clicked

//STEP SEVEN: Let's display the rating under the GIFs

//STEP EIGHT: Let's create a form where the user can type a button they want to add

//STEP NINE: Let's use jQuery to create a new button when the submit button is clicked

//Don't forget to reference Activites in Module 6 from class and the GIPHY API DOCS!!!
